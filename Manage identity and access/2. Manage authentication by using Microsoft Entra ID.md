### Authentication options

Authentication method you choose, is configured by using **Microsoft Entra Connect**, which also provisions users in the cloud


#

**Federated authentication**

#

#

#

Microsoft Entra ID can 

- handle sign-in for users without relying on on-premises components to verify passwords
- hand off user sign-in to a trusted authentication provider such as Microsoft's AD FS

Microsoft Entra ID requires some on-premises components for user-level Active Directory security policies 

- account expired, disabled account, password expired, account locked out, sign-in hours on each user sign-in


Sign-in features **not natively supported** by Microsoft Entra ID:

- Sign-in using third-party authentication solution
- Multi-site on-premises authentication solution

#

**Microsoft Entra ID Protection** 

- requires **Password Hash Sync** regardless of which sign-in method
- Organizations can **fail over to Password Hash Sync** if their primary sign-in method fails and it was configured before the failure event



#

#

**Microsoft Entra Conditional Access** require **Microsoft Entra ID P1** licenses.

**Recommendations**

High availability and disaster recovery

On-premises outage survival

Identity protection (Microsoft Entra ID Protection with Microsoft Entra ID P2)


#

#

#

### Password hash synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID

#

Only **new leaked credentials found** after **enable PHS** will be processed against tenant\
Verifying against previously found credential pairs is not performed

Set up password hash synchronization as a backup if decide to use Federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as your sign-in method

To use password hash synchronization in your environment, you need to:

1. Install Microsoft Entra Connect
2. Configure directory synchronization between your on-premises Active Directory instance and your Microsoft Entra instance
3. Enable password hash synchronization



#

#

### Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication

#

Allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords

#

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f6f9a6-b09e-4563-9b1f-60f1854be5da)

#

You can combine **Pass-through Authentication with the Seamless single sign-on** feature

If you have Windows 10 or later machines, use **Microsoft Entra hybrid join (AADJ)**



#

#

### Federation with Microsoft Entra ID

#

**Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust**

You can federate your on-premises environment with Microsoft Entra ID and use this federation for authentication and authorization

#

#

### What is Microsoft Entra authentication?

#

- Self-service password reset
- Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication
- Hybrid integration to write password changes back to on-premises environment
- Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policies for an on-premises environment
- Passwordless authentication


MFA

- Something you know, typically a password.
- Something you have, such as a trusted device that is not easily duplicated, like a phone or hardware key.
- Something you are - biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan.


#

#

### Passwordless authentication options for Microsoft Entra ID

#

**Microsoft Azure and Azure Government** offer 4 passwordless authentication options that integrate with Microsoft Entra ID

- Windows Hello for Business
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Passkeys FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online 2)
- Certificate-based authentication


#

#

**Windows Hello for Business**


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/395e9cbc-4f90-486f-babd-b016a300ba58)

#

#

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08e7e72-6a68-4270-b733-027eab7dc188)


#

#

1. A user signs into Windows using biometric or PIN gesture. The gesture unlocks the Windows Hello for Business private key and is sent to the Cloud Authentication security support provider, referred to as the Cloud AP provider.

2. The Cloud AP provider requests a nonce (a random arbitrary number that can be used just once) from Microsoft Entra ID.

3. Microsoft Entra ID returns a nonce that's valid for 5 minutes.

4. The Cloud AP provider signs the nonce using the user's private key and returns the signed nonce to the Microsoft Entra ID.

5. Microsoft Entra ID validates the signed nonce using the user's securely registered public key against the nonce signature. Microsoft Entra ID validates the signature and then validates the returned signed nonce. When the nonce is validated, Microsoft Entra ID creates a primary refresh token (PRT) with session key that is encrypted to the device's transport key and returns it to the Cloud AP provider. The Cloud AP provider receives the encrypted PRT with session key

6. The Cloud AP provider uses the device's private transport key to decrypt the session key and protects the session key using the device's Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

7. The Cloud AP provider returns a successful authentication response to Windows. The user is then able to access Windows as well as cloud and on-premises applications without the need to authenticate again (SSO).


#

#

**Microsoft Authenticator**

Authenticator App turns any iOS or Android phone into a strong, passwordless credential

Authenticator app follows the same basic pattern as Windows Hello for Business

#

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb97cf3-be0a-42b9-abbc-65a5ca105b59)

#

#

1. The user enters their username

2. Microsoft Entra ID detects that the user has a strong credential and starts the Strong Credential flow

3. A notification is sent to the app via Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) on iOS devices, or via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) on Android devices.

4. The user receives the push notification and opens the app

5. The app calls Microsoft Entra ID and receives a proof-of-presence challenge and nonce

6. The user completes the challenge by entering their biometric or PIN to unlock private key

7. The nonce is signed with the private key and sent back to Microsoft Entra ID

8. Microsoft Entra ID performs public/private key validation and returns a token


#

#

**Passkeys (FIDO2)**

FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)

Latest standard that incorporates the web authentication (WebAuthn) standard

FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor

If you purchase and plan to use NFC-based security keys, you need a supported NFC reader for the security key

The NFC reader isn't an Azure requirement or limitation. Check with the vendor for your NFC-based security key for a list of supported NFC readers


#

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1e2eb3b-eb8c-46e8-97f6-ea5412c75a05)

#

#

1. The user plugs the FIDO2 security key into their computer
2. Windows detects the FIDO2 security key
3. Windows sends an authentication request
4. Microsoft Entra ID sends back a nonce
5. The user completes their gesture to unlock the private key stored in the FIDO2 security key's secure enclave
6. The FIDO2 security key signs the nonce with the private key
7. The primary refresh token (PRT) token request with signed nonce is sent to Microsoft Entra ID
8. Microsoft Entra ID verifies the signed nonce using the FIDO2 public key
9. Microsoft Entra ID returns PRT to enable access to on-premises resources


#

**FIDO2 security key providers**

- Certificate-based authentication (Microsoft Entra CBA)
- Recommend no more than 20 sets of keys for each passwordless method


#

#

### Implement passwordless authentication

#

- Microsoft Authenticator
- FIDO2-compliant security keys
- Windows Hello for Business

#

#

**Windows Hello for Business**

Prerequisites and deployment paths for Windows Hello for Business are highly dependent on whether you're deploying in 

- on-premises, hybrid, or cloud-only configuration
- It's also dependent on your device join strategy


#

There are three types of passwordless sign-in deployments available with security keys:

1. Microsoft Entra web apps on a supported browser
2. Microsoft Entra joined Windows 10 devices
3. Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10 devices


#

#

### Implement password protection

#

**Design principles**

**- Domain controllers (DCs) never have to communicate directly with the internet.**
- No new network ports are opened on DCs.
- No Microsoft Entra Domain Services schema changes are required. The software uses the existing Microsoft Entra domain container and serviceConnectionPoint schema objects.
- Any supported Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain or forest functional level can be used.
- The software doesn't create or require accounts in the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domains that it protects.
- User clear-text passwords never leave the domain controller, either during password validation operations or at any other time.
- The software isn't dependent on other Microsoft Entra features. For example, Microsoft Entra password hash sync (PHS) isn't related or required for Microsoft Entra Password Protection.
- Incremental deployment is supported, however the password policy is only enforced where the Domain Controller Agent (DC Agent) is installed.


#

#

**Incremental deployment**

Microsoft Entra Password Protection DC agent software can only validate passwords when it's installed on a DC, and only for password changes that are sent to that DC

**How Microsoft Entra Password Protection works**

1. Service Registration: **Password Protection Proxy** service and the **DC Agent** register themselves in Microsoft Entra ID by creating `serviceConnectionPoint` objects. These objects are used for communication, reporting, and diagnostics.

2. Policy Download: **DC Agent** is responsible for downloading the latest password policy from Microsoft Entra ID. It locates a **Password Protection Proxy** service by querying the forest for `serviceConnectionPoint` objects.

3. Policy Request: Once a proxy service is found, the **DC Agent** sends a password policy download request to the proxy, which forwards it to Microsoft Entra ID and returns the response to the **DC Agent**.

4. Policy Storage and Monitoring: DC Agent stores the downloaded policy in a dedicated folder within the domain’s `sysvol` share. It continuously monitors this folder for updates replicated from other domain controllers.

5. Policy Refresh: **DC Agent** requests a new policy at startup and checks the age of the current policy hourly. If the policy is older than one hour, it requests an updated policy via the proxy service.

6. Password Validation: When password change requests are received by a domain controller, the cached policy is used to determine whether the new password is accepted or rejected. 



#

#


**Key considerations and features**


1. **Tenant-Specific Password Policies**: Password policies in Microsoft Entra Password Protection are tenant-specific, combining the **Microsoft global banned-password list** with the **per-tenant custom banned-password list**.

2. **Communication Between DC Agent and Proxy**:
   - The **DC Agent** communicates with the **Proxy Service** via **RPC over TCP**. The proxy listens on a dynamic or static RPC port, depending on configuration.
   - The **DC Agent** does not listen on any network-available port, and the **Proxy Service** never initiates communication with the **DC Agent**.

3. **Stateless Proxy Service**:
   - The **Proxy Service** is stateless and does not cache policies or any other data from Azure.

4. **Password Evaluation**:
   - The **DC Agent** uses the most recent locally available password policy to evaluate passwords. If no policy is available, the password is automatically accepted, and an event log warns the administrator.

5. **Policy Application Delay**:
   - Microsoft Entra Password Protection is not real-time. There may be a delay between policy changes in Microsoft Entra ID and their enforcement across all domain controllers.

6. **Supplement to Existing Policies**:
   - Microsoft Entra Password Protection complements, rather than replaces, existing Microsoft Entra ID password policies and third-party password filter DLLs. All password validation components must agree before a password is accepted. 

This system ensures robust password protection while integrating with existing policies and infrastructure.
